# Artifitial Intellegence

There are several part of AI:

* Pathfinding
* Steering behaviour
* Dialogue system
* Visual scripting (State machine)
* Other...

## Pathfinding

Use [Recast & Detour](https://github.com/memononen/recastnavigation) 
for navmesh building and finding the path.

## Steering behaviour

Use the following libraries for reference:

* [MetaAgent](http://sourceforge.net/projects/metaagent/files/)
* [OpenSteer](https://github.com/meshula/OpenSteer)

*Also read about boid and try to use Detour demos.*

**GroupBehaviour** should be considered as base class 
for scripting the group of objects.

## Dialogue system

Use [Pixel Crushers' Dialogue System](http://www.pixelcrushers.com/dialogue-system-documentation/) 
as reference.

## Visual scripting

Use [PlayMaker](http://www.hutonggames.com/index.html) as a reference.

## Others
Maybe sometime we will invent something new :)
